This repository contains Python implementations of algorithms from the book [*labuladong的算法小抄*](https://www.amazon.com/labuladong%E7%9A%84%E7%AE%97%E6%B3%95%E5%B0%8F%E6%8A%84-%E4%BB%98%E4%B8%9C%E6%9D%A5/dp/7121399334). While the original book provides examples in C, JAVA, and PYTHON, this repository focuses exclusively on Python, converting all code examples to a consistent Python format.

## Contents

- **Algorithm Implementations:** Each algorithm is implemented in Python with detailed comments to enhance understanding.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** The repository includes Jupyter Notebooks for an interactive learning experience, allowing you to run and modify code easily.

## Environment

- Language: Python
- Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook (recommended)

## Getting Started
